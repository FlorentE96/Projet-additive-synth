# ToDo list

- (1)  Filter : generic constructor (to allow bandpass filtering)
- (2)  Fix Echo
- (3)  Reverb
- (4)  Clean inclusion structure
- (5)  Change setters to initialisation lists
- (6)  Fix sound "clipping" in LF
- (7)  Relative pitch dial or ditch Pitc dial
- (8)  Use MPK Pads to change filter type
- (9)  Gate problem for 2 notes (retrigger)
- (10)  Change everything to float/double and see if it improves quality
- (11) Latency (multithread)

# Substractive synthesizer in C++
This project consists in creating a basic East coast substractive synthesizer composed of :

- One or several wavetable oscillators ;
- A multimode state-variable filter ;
- One or several ADSRs ;
- One or several LFOs.

A GUI will let the user set all the parameters, and a MIDI interface will allow control over all the parameters
via an external MIDI controller.

This synthesizer will work on both Linux and Windows platforms.
