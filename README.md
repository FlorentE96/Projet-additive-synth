- Latency (multithread)
- Gate problem for 2 notes (retrigger)
- Relative pitch dial or ditch Pitc dial
- Filter : generic constructor (to allow bandpass filtering)
- Use MPK Pads to change filter type
- Fix Echo
- Clean inclusion structure
- Change setters to initialisation lists
- change everything to float/double and see if it improves quality

# Substractive synthesizer in C++
This project consists in creating a basic East coast substractive synthesizer composed of :

- One or several wavetable oscillators ;
- A multimode state-variable filter ;
- One or several ADSRs ;
- One or several LFOs.

A GUI will let the user set all the parameters, and a MIDI interface will allow control over all the parameters
via an external MIDI controller.

This synthesizer will work on both Linux and Windows platforms.
