# Substractive synthesizer in C++
This project consists in creating a basic East coast substractive synthesizer composed of : 

- One or several wavetable oscillators ;
- A multimode state-variable filter ;
- One or several ADSRs ;
- One or several LFOs.

A GUI will let the user set all the parameters, and a MIDI interface will allow control over all the parameters
via an external MIDI controller.

This synthesizer will work on both Linux and Windows platforms.
